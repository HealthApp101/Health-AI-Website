# Health-AI

Our project aims for the betterment of the healthcare sector in India. We are working on timely detection of diseases on the basis of commonly used medical reports. In India, most of the population underestimates the symptoms of a particular disease and do not consult a doctor in time, which results in pernicious disease eventually.

We are working on a wide range of diseases and detecting them using advanced AI techniques. We aim at providing a free and fast alternative for detecting a disease based on some medical data.We have covered and deployed our project on all platforms(like IOS, android, windows etc.).

Health-AI is a project which uses advanced artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect and predict deadly and life threatening diseases.

Detecting and predicting a disease in terms of healthcare is something extraordinary and remarkable the implications of which can save millions of lives, our project Health-AI has achieved this.

Currently, we can detect and predict upto 11 different diseases and medical conditions.

Beyond this, the services that we offer include but are not limited to Pharmacy information, drugs information, latest news health and healthcare topics and blogs of expert physicians of various topics and trends.

At the end of the day, we are a project aimed to integrate high end technology with the field of healthcare while protecting privacy hence, saving lives and making the world a better place.
